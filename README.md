Common reasons for merge conflict:
- If you and your collaborator both edit the same piece of code in different ways
    - ^ Causes a MC because it can't decide which version of them to keep
- If you delete a file but another person still has the file
    - ^ Code is incompatible
- Lack of communication
    - ^ Prevents team members from knowing what others are doing

Effects of unsolved merge conflicts:
- If you a go long time without commiting and pushing, then when you finally merge, you probably will have a lot of conflicts
-   Loses time that could've been spent on product development, rather than fixing all the conflicts
-   Much harder for the team to collaborate if they don't know what the other people are doing
-   Team doesn't know which design to follow especially since they are all so developed because there wasn't constant pushing
- CREATES STRESS
- Negatively impacts team morale and productivity
