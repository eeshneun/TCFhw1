Common reasons for merge conflict:
- If you and your collaborator both edit the same piece of code in different ways
- ^ Causes a MC because it can't decide which version of them to keep
- If you delete a file but another person still has the file
- ^ Code is incompatible

Effects of unsolved merge conflicts:
- If you a long time without commiting and pushing, then when you finally merge you probably will have a lot of conflicts
-   Lose time that could've been better spent on product development than fixing all the conflicts
-   Much harder for the team to collaborate if they don't know what the other people are doing
-   Team doesn't know which design to follow especially since they are all so developed because there wasn't constant pushing
